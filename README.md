# An Introduction to Modern CMake

[Source](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/)

Why do I need a good build system?

- to use CI (continuous integration)
- support multiple compilers
- describe how your program is structured logically
- to use a library
- to use [Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/), to help you code
- to use a debugger
